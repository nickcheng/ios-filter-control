# Documentation 

The class is not very well documented. I tried documenting drawing code as much as I could.

There are sample codes that illustrate various parameters.


# Usage

## Creating your filter

Somewhere, for example in your viewDidLoad, alloc and init the filter UIControl:

    SEFilterControl *filter = [[SEFilterControl alloc]initWithFrame:CGRectMake(10, 20, 300, 70) Titles:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"Articles", @"News", @"Updates", @"Featured", @"Newest", @"Oldest", nil]];

This initializes our Filter Control using CGRect and Titles Array of NSStrings.

*Note That height of the control is predifined as 70 and can't be changed*

Then, add target for Value Change Event handling:

	[filter addTarget:self action:@selector(filterValueChanged:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventValueChanged];

Don't forget to impelment the handler we specified later:

	-(void)filterValueChanged:(SEFilterControl *) sender{
    	NSLog(@"%@", [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%d", sender.SelectedIndex]);
	}
	
Adding to your UIView & releasing the object:

	[self.view addSubview:filter];
    [filter release];

## Customizing your filter

To change the track color:

	[filter setProgressColor:[UIColor lightGrayColor]];

To change the handler color:

	[filter setHandlerColor:[UIColor darkGrayColor]];

To change the Titles text color:

	[filter setTitlesColor:[UIColor blackColor]];

To change the Titles text font:

	[filter setTitlesFont:[UIFont fontWithName:@"Didot" size:14]];
